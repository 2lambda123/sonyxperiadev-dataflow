# Open Sourcing "DataFlow"

## What?

* Documentation tool.
* Compiler from `.flow` to Graphviz, PlantUML.
* Written in Haskell.

## Why?

* Share the joy!
* Upload to Hackage (Haskell community package database, requires open source
  license). Makes it simpler to consume using standard Haskell tools.
* Enable others to use it, report issues, fix bugs, add new output formats.
* Enable us to continue working on it, even after Sony consulting.

## How?

* Put in github.com/sonymobile?
* Put in on github.com/owickstrom if Sony don't want to put its name on it?

## Future Ideas

* Stronger error reporting.
* Build and expose packages for apt, yum, brew (internally at Sony?).
* Could be exposed as a web service (Heroku?).
